# book-store

## Hello Guys, This project is written for a bookstore. The technology used here is Java 1.8 version, Spring Framework.

### I used :

    Spring Data JPA as ORM technology

    Spring Validation to validate the data
    
    Internal database H2 as a database
    
    Spring Security, JWT, jBCrypt to ensure project security
    
    JUnit Jupiter, Mockito for writing unit tests
    
    Swagger to describe the structure of your APIs
    
### In order to use the written Api, I exported the collections which I created in Postman and added them here.
